<h1 align="center">Spectre Web Workspace</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A powerful, browser-based API & Documentation workspace powered by Lit, CodeMirror, and Vite.</strong>
</p>

---

**Spectre Web Workspace** is the standalone web-based counterpart to the Spectre VS Code extension. It provides a full IDE-like experience in the browser with a split-pane layout, robust file management, and instant live previews for Markdown, OpenAPI specifications, and Diagrams.

## ✨ Features

- **Split-Pane Workspace**: A resizable three-column layout featuring a folder tree, multi-tab code editor, and live previewer.
- **Project & File Management**: Create, edit, and organize files and directories entirely in the browser.
- **Advanced Code Editor**: Powered by CodeMirror 6, offering syntax highlighting for Markdown, YAML, and JSON.
- **Interactive DBML Documentation**: 
  - Generates comprehensive documentation from DBML projects, including a reactive sidebar with **Schemas** and **Groups** modes (preserving table selection on mode switches).
  - Renders custom **Mermaid ER Diagrams** with Ctrl+wheel zoom, pan, and fit tools.
  - Automatically style headers (using `headercolor`) and show schema-qualified table names (`schema.table`) in the diagrams.
  - Displays dynamic Data Dictionary containing columns, settings, indexes (with index notes), and active cross-referenced foreign key links that jump directly to target tables.
- **Live Previews**:
  - **Markdown**: Renders GitHub-flavored markdown instantly.
  - **OpenAPI / Swagger**: Interactive Swagger UI for API documentation and `rapipdf` for PDF generation.
  - **Mermaid Diagrams**: Native diagram rendering.
- **Smart References**: Clickable references in your documents. If a referenced file doesn't exist, the workspace will smartly prompt you to create it and pre-fill it with boilerplate code based on the extension!
- **Global Dialogs & Workflows**: An extensible architecture with custom UI components using Lit.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

The web application is built with **Vite** and **Lit**. Follow these steps to run the application locally:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **Node.js** (v18 or newer recommended)
* **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `web-page` directory and install the required packages:
```bash
cd web-page
npm install
```

### 3. Running the Development Server
To start the Vite development server with hot-module replacement (HMR):
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the provided `localhost` URL in your browser to see the app running.

### 4. Building for Production
To build the optimized static assets for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
You can then preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 📝 DBML Syntax Support & Limitations

The workspace parses DBML using the open-source `@dbml/core` engine (v8.3.0). Certain visual enrichment annotations are exclusive to Holistics' proprietary commercial platforms (`dbdiagram.io` & `dbdocs.io`) and behave according to the compatibility matrix below:

* **Supported Features** (parsed & rendered correctly):
  * Core structures: `Table`, `Enum`, `TableGroup`, and standard `Ref` relationships.
  * Project configurations: `Project` block, note descriptions, and `database_type` metadata.
  * Visual Customizations: Table header colors (`Table users [headercolor: #3498DB]`).
  * Annotations: Notes on Tables, Columns, and Indexes (`[note: '...']` or block notes).
  * Module System: Splitting and importing workspace DBML files via `use` and `reuse` syntax.
* **Unsupported Features** (proprietary to commercial platforms; will throw syntax errors in open-source `@dbml/core` parser):
  * TableGroup settings/colors: `TableGroup group_name [color: #fff, note: '...']` is not supported by the parser grammar.
  * Ref line colors: Custom line colors like `Ref: a.id > b.id [color: #fff]` are rejected.
  * Sticky Notes: Standalone `Note my_note { '...' }` blocks are unrecognized.
  * Diagram Views: `DiagramView` blocks are not supported.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Stack

- **Framework**: [Lit](https://lit.dev/) - A simple library for building fast, lightweight web components.
- **Bundler**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next-generation frontend tooling.
- **Editor**: [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/) - Highly extensible code editor for the web.
- **Preview Renderers**: [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/), [Swagger-UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/).
- **State Management**: Built-in reactive properties using Lit and RxJS for state streams (`projectManager`).
